This is a collection of aspects for AspectJ. AspectJ is a form of aspect oriented programming within Java.
Aspects allows for an increase in modularity due to a reduction of cross cutting concerns. This means it
is capable of adding or modifying the behavior of code without modifying the code itself. It is often used
for elements such as a logging whereby code for logging can be created once and applied as an aspect
to other modules. This enables the logging code to be easily changed to meet requirements.
