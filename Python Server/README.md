These two files are a Python server. One is an HTTP client which uses the request module. The second is the HTTP Server which inherits from
the http server module and also the socket server module. It also has a created PUT function as the inherent module does not contain this.
The folders contain a few files which were simple used to test the functions of the server and client.
