These are the files to a Java application that uses a Swing GUI interface connected via JDBC (Java databased connector) to a mySQL
database. It contains a number of queries to fit within certain requirements of the program. It contains a dump of the database itself
which contains real world numbers though they are a little old at this point.

It also contains a relational schema and ER diagram to show how the database was built. This was done with a group of 3, however,
I coded all of the Java and most of the mySQL queries.
