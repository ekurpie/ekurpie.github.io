These are three files to show understanding of hashing and hash tables as well as order statistics. The hashing file is a object oriented
hash table with 3 different hash functions. It then chooses one function on instantiation which it keeps. The file then demonstrates hashing.

The NthLargest file utilizes a minHeap for the purposes of keeping track of the top 5 highest bids on a stream.

TenthOrder is a file that performs order statistics for the 10th order statistic. It was originally done with a theoretical linear time
median function. As such, the statistics median function is a workaround and is not perfect. Thus it can create problems but the function works
well for its purpose.
