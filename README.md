Welcome to my public GitHub repository for my projects!

If you have been referred from my website please check out any of the projects available above.

If not, please check out my website at ekurpie.github.io/webpage/ 

Each folder is an individual project with some of them being small quick things demonstrating topics such as algorithms and data structures.
Others are fully finished applications or websites some of which were done in groups. I am working on getting a read me in each individual project,
however, this is not yet completed. Also, please note that one folder -- webpage -- is the code to the website itself.

Enjoy!
