These are two files to demonstrate knowledge of algorithms. The bubblesort file is a bubblesort algorithm.
However, it is taken from Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition. This version is a little strange as it
bubblesorts in reverse i.e. the smaller numbers are bubbled down.

The other file is a file to show understanding of recursion. It builds and finds binary numbers that fit a certain length.
