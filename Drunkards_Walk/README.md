This file is a "Drunkard's Walk". Running the program it will ask for a few numbers from you, the user. This includes number of creatures
as well as number of steps that you would like each creature to move. It then generates these "creatures" and moves them according to a grid.
This was a team building and Object Oriented Programming exercise. The creatures inherit from the turtle graphics based within Python and use
this as a building block for everything else. Please note that after running the program, the window often does not pop up but rather will
be in your toolbar. Built with a group of 11 people, I was the main programmer for this project.
