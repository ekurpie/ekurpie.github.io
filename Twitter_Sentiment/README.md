This is the code for a twitter sentiment analysis project. This one also has a published paper to go along with it which was published in
March of 2021. 

The project pulls tweets from Twitter using their API, Tweepy. It then performs some preprocessing and stores them in a MongoDB noSQL database.
It also pulls down the datasets necessary to train the machine learning models. The best model is the SVM or support vector machine. In this instance,
it classifies tweets about my Alma Mater, UNCW.
